<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>My very first film so always a pleasure and it address real struggle students go through in India</p>
<h3>Mr.Queen</h3>
<p>A time-travel K-drama where a very eccentric chef travels back in time and ends up in a Queen's body in Joseon era, Just HILARIOUS! Fabulous acting by female lead</p>
<h3>Kantara</h3>
<p>A Kannada film concentrating on a specific form of worship of a demigod in particular region of Tulu naadu of Karnataka. A true cinematic experience!</p>
